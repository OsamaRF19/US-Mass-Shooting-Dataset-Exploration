Mother Jones Dataset on US mass shootings (Link: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/) was used for this exploraion, which is a self project.

The Presentation of the exploration is available here:

The whole process of coding to presentation is done on best of my abilities over the time of 7 days and made all the visuals that I could think of.
Thank You for your time.
